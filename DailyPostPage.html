		<!-- New Year (1st January)  Post: -->
		<p>
		You are reading this in year 2017, so happy new year! Many people think the
		<br> new year is for doing something new, such as reading a new book, learning a new 
		<br> skill, losing weight and so on. However for 2017 I'd like to give you one goal,
		<br> the goal is to; finish something. Whether it be something you started a long 
		<br> time ago, something you recently started, or somethinh you are going to start,
		<br> finish it before the end of the year.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Having said that I should warn you to choose something which is realistic to complete.
		<br> One of the hardest parts of programming is the beginning, one of the most 
		<br> difficult parts of Indie-development is knowing when to stop. And while 
		<br> its true that there may be times when you stop without wanting to, you are a 
		<br> runner who can only run one race/marathon at a time. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		So for this new year I hope that you finish something, and eating your typical
		<br> Sunday dinner does not count (unless you are rarely eat it all). 
		<br> If you are working on a solo/small project - finish it, preferably before
		<br> you start the next one. 
		<br> Thankyou for reading. 
		</p>
