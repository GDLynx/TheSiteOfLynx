	<p>	Hello, thus post is going to inform you about something known as 'Game Jams'. 
	<br> Which I thought seemed appropriate as the Global Game Jam 2017 is approaching.
	<br> Game jams allow you to quickly prototype ideas and meet other people, among 
	<br> other things.
	</p>
	
	<p> <b> What is a Game Jam? </b>
	<br> A game jam is a type of Hackathon (a session of developing quickly) in which 
	<br> people make a game. They can be done as a group or on your own. Individual
	<br> game jams often have their own rules and participation criteria but in 
	<br> general the goal is to make a game. Similar to a musical jam session except
	<br> with games, and game development. There are various game jams which are
	<br> competitive, and others which are not competitive (but in most cases either 
	<br> philosophy can be applied personally). 
	</p>
	
	<p> <b> Examples of Game Jams </b>
	<br> OneGameAMonth, also known as 1GAM/1gam, is a monthly non-competitive game jam, 
	<br> in which the goal is to make a game before the end of the month, while it is
	<br> true that the jam provides a theme, it does not enforce this theme – meaning
	<br> if your game doesn’t involve the theme then it is still eligible for submission.
	<br> The 1GAM isn’t strictly competitive is because the intention of it is to improve
	<br> personal skills development. There are a great number of developers who state
	<br> that the best way to get better at game development is by making games – for 
	<br> example: Rami Ismail, Vlambeer Studios. The next event worth a mention is
	<br> Ludum Dare,Ludum Dare is unique in that it offers two types of jam experiences, 
	<br> a competitive and non-competitive. You can read more about this (and the other 
	<br> jams) by searching online, unlike 1GAM, Ludum Dare (LD) happens every so often.
	<br> The last jam worth knowing is the Global Game Jam (GGJ). The first two jams have
	<br> been online jams, that is; you can attend them from your home (via computer),
	<br> Global Game Jam however it is a physical event, you are typically required to 
	<br> go to one of the many locations they provide if you wish to participate. Thus, 
	<br> encouraging actual human-social-interaction. Another game jam I recommend is
	<br> the One Hour game jam (1HGJ) which is an online jam which occurs weekly. 
	<br> Be aware Global Game Jam happens in January and since it is January I suggest 
	<br> investigating before the 20th. 
	</p>
	
	<p> <b> Things You May Enjoy Knowing </b>
	<br> <b> Wondering where you can find game jams? </b>
	<br> Itch.io & Gamejolt both have their own game jam calendar. For a much more broader 
	<br> calendar visit IndieGameJams.com – and one person I’d like you to know Is Jupiter
	<b> Hadley. Jupiter Hadley often plays a lot of the games made for
	<br> Itch.io/IndieGameJam/Gamejolt jams then publishes footage of the games onto her 
	<br> Youtube Channel. This, in my opinion is excellent because it gives the developer a 
	<br> chance to witness someone playing their game free of charge.
