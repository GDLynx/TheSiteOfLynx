		<h1><b> Global Game Jam 2017: A Review <b></h1> 
	</div>

	<p>
	You may be aware Global Game Jam 2017 has now ended, I attended and as I said I would do; here is a review for the Global Game Jam 2017. Please keep in mind that while I’m trying not to focus on my personal experience – as I am a private person, this may differ from your experience. With that said, lets continue.
	<br><br><b> Team Forming </b><br>
	I am a shy person therefor I was anxious about attending Global Game Jam this year due to worry of either not being in a group / team and worry that I wouldn’t enjoy being in a group / team, it turns it this was far from anything I should’ve been worried about; other location’s group forming method may differ but the one for me was simply; all those not in a team stood in an open area, those teams who needed a specific role also stood in an open area – raised their hand when the heard ‘artist’ and the artists standing without a team could walk to any one of those groups and that was their team. Sadly, we didn’t get much official information about the groups we could join such as group size, individual skillsets, preferred type of game to develop etcetera. And there didn’t really seem to be a ‘get to know your group’ session but asides from that, getting a team went relatively swiftly.
	<br><br><b> What I Learned </b><br>
	 Global Game Jam is like a crash course in game development, as you’d expect at least one thing will be learned (assuming you aren’t the perfect developer) – I learned mostly that I had to work harder in general. In other words, Global Game Jam has taught me not to slack off. Learned things related to my discipline too. 
	<br><br> I’m not sure about the rest of the location’s but actual development time for ours didn’t started until approximately 7pm, and the jam ended at 5pm – vital hours of development time lost for reasons I am unsure of. And again, this may location’s problem but still; the dinner options were poor – don’t even know if we had an option. But seeing as how the Global Game Jam is dependent on donations this is forgivable. And the place got real cold at night, meaning if you weren’t wrapped up; working during the night / into the morning was difficult + unpleasant (unless you’re a polar bear or something).
	<br><br> This is possibly because the group forming went smooth but despite not being a student at the university in which the site was held (it was filled with students) – there was little to no time in which I felt someone didn’t want me at the jam. And within the first night a few members of other teams came to discuss ours and their games – providing feedback and seeming interested which was nice, perhaps they were just prowling for ideas to steal but they did offer help.
	<br><br> I thought we would be split into our own rooms meaning teams would have privacy but this wasn’t the case, the rest of the university was restricted and we jammed in this large hall meaning it was easy to nosey at what the other teams were developing. Despite the lack of privacy everyone seemed to mind their own business and produce their own game without any immoral idea theft so that demonstrates everyone maintained the positive sprit of the game jam.
	<br> While the teams were fairly spaced out meaning we didn’t feel cramped, and there was onsite staff (possibly security) there, including cameras and so on; I was a little disappointed with the lack of storage facilities – everyone just kept their stuff with them or at their workspace.
	<br> The theme was ‘waves’ – an interesting theme, well thought of to improve results for those interesting, unique games – and yes I did see some worth a mention for innovation / creativity. And the range of creativity and innovation was proven in the play-session which occurred right after the jam. The play-session brought some non-jammers in ensuring there were general players to trial the games. All players of games were polite, didn’t hold back from trying a game, and provided usable feedback. So; the play-session went well too. Overall the jam went too. My only complaint about the play-session is that it was too soon after the jam – meaning developers had little preparation time to setup their games for playing.
