	This month (January) Global Game Jam happens, on the 20th until the 22nd. Earlier I made a post about game jams in general, now I would like to focus on the Global Game Jam. About The Jam Global Game Jam is unique compared to most jams in that it is (strictly) a physical event, meaning you (in most cases) can’t compete from the comforts of your own. This is great as it enables (and perhaps) forces you to communicate, socialise and interact with others, much like you may in a real work environment. Only drawback is that you may experience the frustrating consequences brought on by limited resources – a lack of computers for example.

	<b> Reasons To Attend </b> <br> <br> You may be attending the Global Game Jam for more than one reason so here’s some examples. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		<!-- <ul> -->
			<br> To meet new friends & possible acquaintances <br> you may decide that your team is an excellent team and it may become your official independent game studio, or you may just find someone worth knowing and decide to keep in touch with this person. 
			<br><br> To try out new ideas (or perfect) old ones) <br> Game jams tend to be the best for prototyping, you may even have an old idea which you weren’t sure how to accomplish on your own, being able to talk something through with someone else can often help you rethink your idea, or maybe you just don’t have the experience to do so and you find someone who does. 
			<br><br> To Impress <br> you may simply want to see how skilled you are compared to others such as students, you may be top of your class but are top of everyone’s class? 
			<br><br> To be impressed Inspired <br> This is similar to spectating pretty much any sporting event, plus seeing someone else work may help you improve your own workflow. Seeing others think creatively (as opposed to simply seeing the finish project) may improve your ability to ‘think outside the box’ 
			<br><br> To make a game – it’s a game jam, duh. 
		<!-- </ul> -->
	</p>
	<br>
	<br> 
	
	<p>
	<br> I personally do not know how worthwhile the Global Game Jam is, which is why I too will be attending one of the many Global Game Jam locations. I will be sharing my experience after the jam is over so keep an eye out for when I do so, I hope you have a positive Global Game Jam 2017.
