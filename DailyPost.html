	Hello, hope you had a good Valentine’s day. In this post I will be suggesting five ways to improve game feel using sound (sound effects and / or music). <br><br>
	Game-feel / game feel is the quality of output given to the player as they interact within your game world. Videogames are mostly about stimulating the mind & good game-feel should do this well. <br><br> 
Music volume increases to emphasise danger <br>
This is a tactic many games have used, especially action games, such as intense fighting music in a shooter during combat but the regular background music when all enemies are dead or too far to fight. <br><br>
Music tempo increases / decreases to hint the player is closed to an object <br>
Similarly, to the first one, this could be used in a puzzle game to hint that the player is on the right track – a music ‘hot or cold’ if you will. <br><br>
Use different pitches & length of the same sound effect, it’s the same but different <br><br>
I’m sure many will agree that hearing the same sound over again can become boring and sometimes frustrating – especially if the sound is disliked, to add some flavour and prevent this – try making the pitch of your sound effect slightly different to that of the last each time – try and keep it subtle. <br><br>
Sound effects which match the texture (of graphics) <br>
If you have an object in your game which is short and sharp, why not make the note associated with that object short & sharp (high pitched)? <br><br>
Strategically prioritized sound effects / music to influence the overall flow of the game <br>
This could be as simple as a cheery musical piece played when the player wins and a dreary musical piece when the player loses. Or it could be music which is designed to create and induce tension during the tense parts of game play, music which is inspiring during those victorious moments, and music which makes you feel ready to take on the world during those ‘take on the world’ moments. <br><br>
Use the sound to juice up your game and emphasise those key mechanics that should make your game worth playing. Thanks for reading.
