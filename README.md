# TheSiteOfLynx
Website. 

About:
This is a website dedicated to programming (and similar) related topics, the site is intended to be made with the use of as little money 
as possible. And is merely a blog, the secondary purpose of the site is to give me a 'side project' to keep me distracted from the harsher parts
of life - the primary purpose being to inform. 

The site does not yet have a true custom domain name however I will be referring to it (for now) as TheSiteOfLynx.
